      <h1 class="beef">How do we plan on doing it?</h1>
      <article>We are starting by taking action in two things. One being personal transportation. We here at K.A.T.F we understand not every child has the opportunity to catch the bus or drive to school, and not every parent has the funds to own a car to get to and from work reliably. While public transportation is available it is not always the best option. As a helping hand we will provide every child enrolled in our program with free transportation via shuttle busses. Every child will be at school and have a secured safe ride back home. Two; We know the parents in low income areas might have to work two maybe even three jobs! With that being said we will provide industry leading child care services after scool for children 1-18 grades k-12. Not only is our transportation free and easy to use but now you have a guarenteed way of knowing your child is being monitered and kept out of trouble. </article>
