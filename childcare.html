      <p class = "six"> For all of our busy parents out there, we know you care about your children and many of you are working hard in order to provide for them. Here at K.A.T.F we want to help out as best as we can, so we have created an after school child care program just for you. We have various locations across Charlotte, and we will provide the transportaion for your child to get there. Our program is tailored for all children K-12. For our younger students, we want them to have some fun time after school so they will be playing games indoors, sports, and a various range of activities to keep them busy! For our older students, we will provide a free tutoring service in the center we have created. Students can choose to use their after school time to take advantage of this opportunity or choose to use their free time to relax and enjoy their hobbies. We will have three tutors in each center at all times with the ability to help in any subject. We have also placed computers in each center for students to use. We want all your children to be in the best care possible, and have all opportunities available to them! </p>
